Q) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A) Diff only pinpoints the lines which are changed. Thus making the search space a lot smaller.
It uses "-" for old lines and "+" for new lines.

Q) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A) You can restore to older versions if you accidently break your code.

Q) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A) Pros:
- The commits have a semantic meaning.

Cons:
- You may forget to commit :v

Q) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A) Yeah

Q) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A) git log shows history. The commit ID comes first, the commit message appears last so beware.
git diff older_version newer_vision
